Q1 : What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created. This creates the metadata (or information) that helps keep track of the files your are creating or updating.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files are 'added' to be tracked. Not all files in the working directory are in the staging area and tracked unless they have been added. 

The respository is for files that have been committed from the staging area. Not all files in the staging area are stored in the repository unless they are 'committed'. 

The staging area  serves as a buffer zone.
